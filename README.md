## Miner, a framework to collect data from rss and
## mail sources.

### Miner v0.0.0 is not functional

Miner is a set of classes to allow collection and
management of RSS, email, and other social media content.
The idea is based on the success I have had mining topic
specific information, and how lame it was that this is
not a trivial application that anyone can't acquire,
configure and use.  Google's news was a nice app, and I
was disappointed that this is not available for folks.

The app consists of python classes and a wrapper application
that allows for feeds to be setup, and then monitored daily.
Topic keyword mining is the easiest use case, with NLP features
being provided next.

The presentation layer is restful with JSON output, and there
is a simple web app that allows for configuration, management,
viewing and searching of content.
